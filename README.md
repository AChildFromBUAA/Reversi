# Reversi

A Java project implements Reversi and its AI. 

## About AI

This AI algorithm is based on greedy method to calculate scores of every pieces on board and action force. It simulates several steps to find relatively optimal solutions. The difficulty of AI is determined by the number of steps of simulation.

Easy: 1 step; Normal: 3 steps; Hard: 5 steps.

## Something need to say

When I did this project, I did not know anything about AI. Thus, the algorithm is a primary one, and some day I will update the algorithm, like minimax tree with Alphaâ€“beta pruning, and probably neural network.
